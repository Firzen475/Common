This metric is useful for diagnosing the root cause of an out-of-memory error, because the limiter trades memory for CPU time when the GC's CPU time gets too high.

The first GC cycle is cycle 1, so a value of 0 indicates that it was never enabled.                                                                                                                                    | ---       |
